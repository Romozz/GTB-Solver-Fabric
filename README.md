# GTB-Solver-Fabric
GTBSolver is a Minecraft mod designed for the Hypixel server's Guess The Build game. It allows players to input patterns (e.g., a___z or apple_), and the mod will return a list of possible words that fit the pattern, such as "apple" or "арбуз". This mod helps improve the guessing experience by suggesting relevant words based on partial patterns
